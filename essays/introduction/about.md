The collaborative ***really awesome*** essays collected here, an ongoing project from an [advanced undergraduate historiography seminar](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/historiography/) at the University of New Mexico, take both a chronological and thematic approach to highlighting important developments, shifts, inflection points, continuities, and ruptures in the way people have conceived and produced historical interpretations.

The intent of this collection is modest but relevant to students of history and to the evaluation of historical narrative. Through the dissection of historiography, our team has compiled a series of topics and paradigms in which one should analyze history. While some areas of examination are traditional and expected to be included in a compilation of historiographical insight, other areas are commonly overlooked or neglected by academics. Each writer brings their field of expertise and passion to their section, ensuring thoughtfulness and diligence. By collaborating with more than a dozen students of history, each with their own perspectives and focuses of study, this work acts as a uniquely specialized compilation of historiographical themes that spans the breadth of human civilization.

This project is also aspires to be a working example on public history and a model for sustainable and adaptable student scholarship. The essays are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and stored in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unm-historiography/metahistory), the website itself is generated through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
