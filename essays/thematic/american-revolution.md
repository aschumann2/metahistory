For centuries now, historians have debated the causes and character of the American War of Independence to better understand the nation’s founding. People, places, and documents associated with revolution are frequently scrutinized from nearly every ideological lens. As a result, the American Revolution itself has been characterized differently in each subsequent generation’s historical writings. The historiography of the American Revolution, then, serves as a case study in how political divisions within society produce dueling historiographical paradigms. Even today, the debate over how historical figures and iconography ought to be represented in contemporary works.

# 1781-1829: Colonial Histories 

The initial histories of the American Revolution were written by those who lived through the events of the war and published works in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These early histories featured starkly different characterizations of the revolution and its participants, unsurprisingly shaped by the authors differing allegiances during the conflict. 

## Revolutionary Interpretation

Among the first histories to be composed in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War was [David Ramsay](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/david-ramsay/)’s *The History of the American Revolution* (1789). Ramsay was intimately involved with the events of the Revolution, serving as a surgeon in the Continental Army and later a delegate to the Continental Congress from South Carolina. His writings portray the revolution as “a mass of husbandmen, merchants, mechanics, and fishermen… guided by the leading strings of the mother country… [in] a situation that needed the abilities of all its sons,” resulting in “a vast expansion of the human mind.” (Ramsay 315) In the vein of Enlightenment historiography, Ramsey argues that the American Revolution pushed humanity forward by actualizing an emerging philosophy of government centered on individual liberty. Ramsay also touched on how the Revolution acted as a unifying cause for what were previously disparate peoples, thus creating a truly national American character for the first time.

Notable as the first female historian of the American Revolution, [Mary Otis Warren](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mercy-Otis-Warren) offered a similarly  positive view of the war. Like Ramsay, Warren involved herself heavily in revolutionary effort, publishing satirical plays and pamphlets which mocked royal authority in Massachusetts. In her in her *History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution* (1805), Warren declares that “Future generations will… never forget the energetic struggles of their fathers to secure the natural rights of men…established in the United States by a race of independent spirits who have freed their posterity from the feudal vassalage of hereditary lords.” (Warren 647) From this, it is clear that the presence of righteous American patriots and their immoral British rulers that was so common in Warren’s dramatic compositions carried over into and historical writings. 

Evident in both Ramsay and Warren’s histories is the concept of the American Revolution as a profoundly moral event, taken up by righteous American patriots who ushered in a new era of human development by eschewing European rule. Crucial to this historical framework is the **interjection of a moral arc to history**, with revolutionaries and loyalists cast as heroes and villains respectively. Equally important is the **construction a new national identity**, deliberately forged as a method of rallying the citizens of the newly independent United States. 

## Loyalist Interpretation 

Of course, historians favorable to the British published their own histories of the American Revolution once the conflict concluded. Notable among these authors was [Thomas Hutchinson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hutchinson), the former royal governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony and subject of many a prodding pamphlet produced by Mercy Otis Warren. In his writings, Hutchinson justified the British policies that generated discontent within the colonies, including the Stamp Act of 1765, asserting that such measures were necessary to reduce the debt accrued from French and Indian War. In his *Detailed Narrative of the Origin and Early Stages of the American Revolution*, Hutchinson also makes note of the distinct feeling of betrayal brought on by the revolution, recalling “All of a sudden, the officers of the crown, and such as were for keeping up their authority, were branded with the name of Tories, always the term of reproach.” Given his role as a royal authority, Hutchinson predictably takes umbrage with the hero-villain dynamic featured in revolutionary histories, instead offering a loyalist account which justifies the controversial acts of Parliament and questions the colonial distain for the crown. 

While Hutchinson used historical narrative to excuse the acts of the British, other loyalist historians focused on the harmful exploits of colonial revolutionaries. In his *Origin & Progress of the American Rebellion* (1829), [Peter Oliver](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/oliver-peter-1713-1791) details “the distresses of some of those people who, from a sense of their duty to the King and a reverence for his laws, have behaved quietly and peacably, and for which reason they have been deprived of their liberty, abused in their persons, and suffer’d such barbarous cruelties, insults, and indignities beside the loss of their property by the hands of lawless mobs and riots as would have been disgraceful even for savages to have committed.” Behooved to write such an angry account largely as a consequence of his own personal loss, having been forcibly removed from his post as a Justice in Massachusetts Bay, Oliver casts the American Revolution and its supporters in an exceedingly grim light, depicting revolutionaries as a violent mob intent spreading chaos and destruction.

Whether defending the actions of the royal authorities or condemning the activities of colonial revolutionaries, loyalist interpretations illustrated in the works of Hutchinson and Oliver showcase a markedly antagonistic representation of the American Revolution and its supporters. Loyalist writers also tended to moralize history, but in the adverse direction of their revolutionary counterparts. As such, the **early historiography of America’s founding reveals how the political divisions between colonial historians cultivated dueling historical paradigms, both of which featured moralistic condemnations of their opponents.**

To understand ancient Rome requires a deep sense of tradition that Romans believed in. This sense of tradition came from a great respect for the ancestors of Rome. The *antiquarians* (one who studies or collects antiques) and jurists (expert writer) investigated the relics of “bygone and often forgotten ages”. (Kelly, 49) This look into origins comes with a problem for the scholar [Aulus Gellius](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0200.xml), namely what is *“the precise meaning of ancient words and their correct etymologies”* (**Understanding**). (Kelly, 51) This is a key problem that modern historians have and even for Romans in the “ancient” world *understanding* was an issue “for long lapse of time has rendered old words and customs obsolete”. (Kelly, 51) Without *understanding* your sources historian cannot do “true history” as the Roman, Sempronius Asellio, said “one should also show with what purpose and for what reason things were done”. (Kelly, 52) Even in ancient times they knew the importance of truly *understanding* your sources and their **intentions**.

The ancient Romans created key concepts for defining "truth" by solidifying their belief in historical facts and by criticizing one another's historical writings. Tacitus is by far the most trusted Roman historian because he told “no story to excite wonder; I do but relate what I have heard and what our fathers recorded”. (Kelly, 63) This regard for reporting the **facts** rather than telling a story was part of Tacitus’ “sharper analytical instrument, not the byways of Herodotean cultural history, but rather the Thucydidean model of mainly contemporary politico-military or “pragmatic” history”. (Kelly, 63) However more “truthful” reporting of facts was, “*none of these historians were “objective”* in a modern sense; all were eager to celebrate the moral virtues which had made Rome great”. (Kelly, 65)
One of those historians, [Cicero](http://www.iep.utm.edu/cicero/), is crucial to our **methodology of truth** within historiography, with his **two laws** regarding **historical writing**. The **first law** states: “that an author must not dare to tell anything but the truth”. (Kelly, 66) The **second law** states: “that he must make bold to tell the **whole** truth”. These two laws of Cicero led to an understanding that the “standard of truth was also what distinguished history from its sister art, poetry”. (Kelly, 66) These two laws created **formal historical writing**, requiring:

1. Chronological arrangement
2. Geographical context
3. Consideration of the causes and consequences of actions
4. Consideration for the portrayal of actors
5. All the above must be done in a smooth narrative

According to the Roman [Quintilian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Quintilian) history was the third of three different forms of narrative, the other two being fiction and realism. This **historical narrative**, "which is an exposition of actual fact" according to Quintilian, has its formal institutional beginnings in ancient Rome. (Kelly, 67) If a historian didn't adequately have a formal structure that emphasized truth then they were **criticized by their contemporaries**.
[Livy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Livy), a Roman historian famed for his rhetoric, was not considered true enough for Quintilian because "Livy for instance is frequently in doubt as to what actually occurred". (Kelly, 68) In ancient Rome we have our first instance of the "practice of historical criticism and exposure of myth, usually associated with philology and pure scholarship", because of the Romans' belief in the role of **rhetoric** and **truth** in **historical writing**. (Kelly, 68) However, Truth had not yet become the center of historiograhpy because in ancient Rome it was that "truth remained a formal requirement... but effective communication to a sophisticated readership was the dominant consideration (rhetoric)". (Kelly, 69) With the ancient Romans we have the beginning of a formal institution of truth within Historiography and the formal requirements regarding historical writing.


# 1900-1940: Progressive Approach
After the legalistic tradition of Rome the role of Truth changes drastically during the Christian dominated transition period from Imperial Rome to the Middle Ages. The role of the historian also changed during this period, with their purpose being “to find the higher spiritual meaning which lay behind the letter of the human record”. (Kelly, 75) The historian [Josephus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Flavius-Josephus), who lived in Imperial Rome, considered himself to be “devoted to the truth as he was to his nation, and he “insisted on the extreme antiquity” of Israel. (Kelly, 78,79) He begins a long tradition of Christian historians relying on sheer age or “tradition” to be the foundation of deciding truth. Josephus emphasized a type of universal history that would solidify this tradition of understanding truth, by arguing:

1. The antiquity of Israel being farther back than Egypt or Babylon, and this sheer age being grounds for superiority and/or having God’s favor.
2. Josephus was an ally of truth, and he understand the world through the lens of his Jewish perspective, while denying classical tradition.
3. Due to the role of the Holy Scriptures of Israel, Josephus privileged the making and preservation of written records.

Another founding principle of Christian authors was the belief that “**truth is in the word of God**, which must be obeyed on the grounds of authority”. (Kelly 81) The historian [Clement](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Clement-of-Alexandria), believed in this principle and took it farther. He argued, “without the light of the Gospel, however, “Human traditions [are] intellectual nonsense”, and he believed in the “unified truth of Christianity”. (Kelly, 82) These principles pushed the classical form of truth **below** that of the Christian interpretation of truth because many Christian authors believed “Christian history was the expression of a higher **truth**”. (Kelly, 83)

%}
This continued with the celebrated Christian historian and theologian, [Augustine of Hippo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Augustine), because his “conversion drew him away from the sectarian search for wisdom to the **stable** truth of the Gospel”. (Kelly, 91) Augustine justified this belief by stating that “history itself is not … among human institutions.”, and that “for events which have already occurred and cannot be undone are to be considered as part of world order, whose found and ruler is God.” (Kelly, 95) This was considered the higher spiritual meaning of history and “secular history, is a written form of human memory, and perhaps even more fallible”. (Kelly, 95) Also, “history represents a level of reading that corresponds to human language in its grammatical sense”. (Kelly, 95)

These two principles would be seen in the debate within Christianity between the **letter** and **spirit** of the law. For Christians the problem lies in the interpretation of written texts whether secular or spiritual. The interpretation of written texts eventually leads to the consensus that “the letter of the old law was the way of death, and only the spirit offered life.” (Kelly, 96) Repeatedly history is “occupying at once the lowest and the most fundamental level(s)”, and this low regard of history will be seen again in the later Middle Ages. (Kelly, 97)


# 1940-1960: Social History and the Ideological 

## Neo-Whigs 

## The New Left

The Early Middle Ages are more important for historiography than one would think. Other than medieval historians attempts to save the manuscripts of the past they laid the foundations of what would one day become secular historiography. Although the origins of the barbarian nations of Europe were based in myth, they were the beginnings of **secular history** antithetical to the universal religious history taught by the Catholic Church. This foundation for **secular history** was created by history being consider more *practical* and having “to do with rhetoric and liberal arts (rather) than the higher forms of knowledge such as philosophy and theology”. (Kelly, 100) This **subordinate** role of history may have been its’ salvation because the Christian church wouldn’t have seen the temporal role of history as a threat to divine Church doctrine. For these first “secular” historians, they regarded “history as a major force in the drive toward a truth that was divine as well as human”, and this truth value for these historians lied in their wanting to understand “the larger world of God’s creation”. (Kelly 101)

Also in Europe, during the Early Middle Ages we begin to see the start of a distinction between **chroniclers**, compilers of facts and data, and the **historian**, the one whom finds the meaning behind historical events.  (Kelly, 103) Chroniclers, tell us what happened; historians tell us why it happened and why it mattered. We also begin to see the end of myth-histories near the end of this period with the **criticism and rejection** of the mythical tales of King Arthur. The tales of King Arthur were made historical by [Geoffrey of Monmouth](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Geoffrey-of-Monmouth) but were immediately assailed by his contemporary historians, and his work was label as **fiction**. (Kelly, 113) This is the **foundations for scholarship** as we know it in the west and historians became more **critical** of one another’s work. Although this scholarship still lacked a *formal academic discipline*, these actions by medieval historians laid the foundations of scholarship for later renaissance and enlightenment historians. The medieval age may not have been the most stable or prosperous, but its' historians aided historiography immensely.

Within this period we begin to see a **stronger criticism** of ancient sources and even as the Renaissance historians praised the ancients. They also criticized their work *to the point of discovering forgeries*. One example is the historical criticism work of the historian [Petrarch](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Petrarch) on the Caesar grant for Austria. (Kelly, 133) Petrarch used historical ideas to reveal the ancient grant that exempted Austria from imperial jurisdiction as a forgery. This work to reveal forgeries became widespread during the Renaissance and illustrates the increased criticism towards the ancients of Rome and Greece.

The Italian city-states during the Renaissance were not only pioneers of art and science, but they contributed greatly to historiography. One italian historian, [Bruni](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-Bruni), displays Renaissance historiographical method rather well. In his **chronicle** of the city-state of Florence, he employed: *Ciceronian laws of truth*, a structured *explanatory narrative*, and only *documentary sources* of the "known history of Florence" by *rejecting mythical foundations*. His chronicle was also an example of the new **humanist** wave of historiography sweeping through Italy and a critical humanistic historiography would be continued by future Italian chroniclers.

During the reformation movement a battle occurred between protestant and catholic historiographers. The main point of conflict was which of the two branches of christianity were more "traditional", by having closer roots to the first christians. The role of **tradition** was of paramount importance to both sides of the Christian reform movement,and history allowed for each side to attempt to legitimize their argument. (Kelly, 172) For the Catholic historiographer, [Casare Baronio](http://catholicsaints.info/catholic-encyclopedia-venerable-cesare-baronius/), his chosen form was annals because it allowed for a writing that was within the rigid requirements demanded by truth. However, the arguments presented by Baronio were quickly rejected by reformist historiographers, and the debate continued into the next few centuries. (Kelly, 173)

Also during this period, the old medieval myths of Trojan origins and Carolingian creation were dismantled by historiographers during this period. (Kelly, 179) In the place of these medieval myths arose new modern myths of nationalistic foundations. (Kelly, 181) In England during this period, the historian [William Camden](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Camden) used a critical and impartial method to analyze the causes of historical events. (Kelly, 184) Other English historians during this period used historical scholarship and criticism to help recreate the English past. This period may not be filled with great sweeping changes of the medieval or renaissance period in terms of historiography, but it helped push along historiography into becoming an academic discipline.

The key event for historiography in regards to truth was the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment created a **formal methodology** that allowed for more **impartiality and Ciceronian truth** to be found in historical writings. (Kelly, 190) The key to this is the amount of **source criticism** that was being used by the historians of the Enlightenment. They worked to reveal forgeries of the past, consulted many authors of the past on a particular subject, and began to create a formal methodology aimed towards universals rather than particulars. (Kelly, 193)

The **secularization** and **codification** of history were critical to the creation of an **academic discipline** that would become academic history.  (Kelly, 198) To codify history is to know “not only what is said, but also by whom it is said, with what words it is said, in what time, on what occasion, what precedes, and what follows”. (Kelly, 205) This codification would be critical to the **methodology** of history, since reliance on credible sources is essential. The secularization of history is what allowed history to finally become a real **academic discipline**. The removal of church influence allowed history to be more impartial and search for a truth that could contradict the teachings of the Church.

With these pillars of history being raised we can finally get to the **scholarship** that was also key to history becoming an academic discipline. [The Republic of Letters](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu/casestudies/voltaire.html), a network of correspondence between scholars, began a more comprehensive discussion between historians of different educational traditions. This “republic” is what allowed for discussion between Italians, French, German, and British historians, which began the academic discipline. Their work towards a **truer academic discipline** is what eventually led to historiography as we know it today.
