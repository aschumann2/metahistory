For centuries now, historians have debated the causes and character of the American Revoluion to better understand the nation’s founding. People, places, and documents associated with revolution are frequently scrutinized from nearly every ideological lens. As a result, the American Revolution itself has been characterized differently in each subsequent generation’s historical writings. The historiography of the American Revolution, then, serves as a case study in how political divisions within society produce dueling historiographical paradigms. Even today, debate rages on over how the Revolution and the Founding Fathers ought to be represented in our history.

# 1781-1829: Early Histories 

The initial histories of the American Revolution were written by those who lived through the events of the war and published works in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. These early histories featured starkly different characterizations of the revolution and its participants, unsurprisingly shaped by the authors differing allegiances during the conflict. 

## Revolutionary Interpretation

Among the first histories to be composed in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War was [David Ramsay](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/david-ramsay/)’s *The History of the American Revolution* (1789). Ramsay was intimately involved with the events of the Revolution, serving as a surgeon in the Continental Army and later a delegate to the Continental Congress from South Carolina. His writings portray the revolution as “a mass of husbandmen, merchants, mechanics, and fishermen… guided by the leading strings of the mother country… [in] a situation that needed the abilities of all its sons,” resulting in “a vast expansion of the human mind.” (Ramsay 315) In the vein of Enlightenment historiography, Ramsey argues that the American Revolution pushed humanity forward by actualizing an emerging philosophy of government centered on individual liberty. Ramsay also touched on how the Revolution acted as a unifying cause for what were previously disparate peoples, thus creating a truly national American character for the first time.

Notable as the first female historian of the American Revolution, [Mary Otis Warren](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mercy-Otis-Warren) offered a similarly  positive view of the war. Like Ramsay, Warren involved herself heavily in revolutionary effort, publishing satirical plays and pamphlets which mocked royal authority in Massachusetts. In her in her *History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revolution* (1805), Warren declares that “Future generations will… never forget the energetic struggles of their fathers to secure the natural rights of men…established in the United States by a race of independent spirits who have freed their posterity from the feudal vassalage of hereditary lords.” (Warren 647) From this, it is clear that the presence of righteous American patriots and their immoral British rulers that was so common in Warren’s dramatic compositions carried over into and historical writings. 

Evident in both Ramsay and Warren’s histories is the concept of the American Revolution as a profoundly moral event, taken up by righteous American patriots who ushered in a new era of human development by eschewing European rule. Crucial to this historical framework is the **interjection of a moral arc to history**, with revolutionaries and loyalists cast as heroes and villains respectively. Equally important is the **construction a new national identity**, deliberately forged as a method of rallying the citizens of the newly independent United States. 

## Loyalist Interpretation 

Of course, historians favorable to the British published their own histories of the American Revolution once the conflict concluded. Notable among these authors was [Thomas Hutchinson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hutchinson), the former royal governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony and subject of many a prodding pamphlet produced by Mercy Otis Warren. In his writings, Hutchinson justified the British policies that generated discontent within the colonies, including the [Stamp Act of 1765](https://www.britannica.com/event/Stamp-Act-Great-Britain-1765), asserting that such measures were necessary to reduce the debt accrued from [French and Indian War](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1750-1775/french-indian-war). In his *Detailed Narrative of the Origin and Early Stages of the American Revolution*, Hutchinson also makes note of the distinct feeling of betrayal brought on by the revolution, recalling “All of a sudden, the officers of the crown, and such as were for keeping up their authority, were branded with the name of Tories, always the term of reproach.” (Hutchinson 4) Given his role as a royal authority, Hutchinson predictably takes umbrage with the hero-villain dynamic featured in revolutionary histories, instead offering a loyalist account which justifies the controversial acts of Parliament and questions the colonial distain for the crown. 

While Hutchinson used historical narrative to excuse the acts of the British, other loyalist historians focused on the harmful exploits of colonial revolutionaries. In his *Origin & Progress of the American Rebellion* (1829), [Peter Oliver](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/oliver-peter-1713-1791) details “the distresses of some of those people who, from a sense of their duty to the King and a reverence for his laws, have behaved quietly and peacably, and for which reason they have been deprived of their liberty, abused in their persons, and suffer’d such barbarous cruelties, insults, and indignities beside the loss of their property by the hands of lawless mobs and riots as would have been disgraceful even for savages to have committed.” (Oliver 3) Behooved to write such an angry account largely as a consequence of his own personal loss, having been forcibly removed from his post as a Justice in Massachusetts Bay, Oliver casts the American Revolution and its supporters in an exceedingly grim light, depicting revolutionaries as a violent mob intent spreading chaos and destruction.

Whether defending the actions of the royal authorities or condemning the activities of colonial revolutionaries, loyalist interpretations illustrated in the works of Hutchinson and Oliver showcase a markedly antagonistic representation of the American Revolution and its supporters. Loyalist writers also tended to moralize history, but in the adverse direction of their revolutionary counterparts. As such, the **early historiography of America’s founding reveals how the political divisions between colonial historians cultivated dueling historical paradigms, both of which featured moralistic condemnations of their opponents.**

# 1830-1889: Whig Histories

For the bulk of the 19th century, Whig historians – labelled after the conservative political movement of the same name – wrote and promoted histories of the American Revolution. These works built on the revolutionary histories of prior scholars, but with heavier emphasize on __providence__ and __nationalism__. Whig histories are fundamentally _romantic works_, often embellishing the events of the revolution to offer a __heroic image of the Founding Fathers__ and instill in readers the sense that the __United States is a uniquely exceptional country__.

These themes are best observed in the writings of [George Bancroft](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Bancroft-American-historian), an American statesmen and avid antiquarian, who published a comprehensive, multi-volume set of books entitled _The History of the United States from the discovery of the American continent_ (1854–1860). Bancroft’s History paints the American Revolution as a divine inspired event headed up by men of legend. In early chapters, Bancroft details the exceptional nature of the American colonists which spurred them toward revolution: “The idea of freedom had never been wholly unknown; [but] in America it was the breath of life to the people. For the first time it [freedom] had found a region and a race, where it could be professed with earnestness and defended with enthusiasm.” (Bancroft 22) Later, Bancroft details the character of those historical figures who made the revolution possible: “Washington was a man of action… Integrity was so completely the law of his nature, that a planet would sooner have shot from its sphere, than he have departed from his uprightness.” (Bancroft 398). Throughout the text, Bancroft weaves religious allusions into his telling of the revolution. This is well illustrated in his description of the first revolutionaries to die in the conflict: “Seven of the men at Lexington were killed, nine wounded…these village heroes prove[d] by their spirit that they were a race divine; from the example of Him who laid down his life on the cross for the life of humanity…” (Bancroft 294-5)

From describing Geroge Washington as a perfect paragon of virtue to comparing the sacrifce of revolutionary soldiers to that of the Crucifixion, Bancroft's work is perhaps the best example of how __Whigs imbued their histories with an evangelical and nationalist ideology__. Beyond their historiographical importance, Whig histories contributed to a number of 19th century cultural developments, including the [Second Great Awakening](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Second-Great-Awakening) and [Manifest Destiny](https://www.britannica.com/event/Manifest-Destiny). It would not be until the turn of the century that Whig histories were seriously challenged. 

# 1889-1950 Imperial School 

Toward the end of the 19th century another strain of historiographical thought emerged, dubbed the “Imperial School.” A new crop of historians, including Charles McLean Andrews and Lawrence Gipson re-oriented the study of the American colonial period, writing their histories from the perspective of British policymakers. Harkening back to the Loyalist histories of old, __imperial histories depict the American Revolution not as a rebellion against a tyrannical monarch, but instead as the inevitable result of reasonable imperial policies which the American colonies defied__.

In a seminal article on colonial history in the _Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898_, [Charles M. Andrews](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-McLean-Andrews) became the first historian to __consider the British perspective of the colonial period__ in nearly a century, explaining that “our colonial history has been written from but one point of view - that of the  colonies…  that is, we have neglected the standpoint of the mother country,  of which we were a part. We have left largely unexamined the system which English statesmen elaborated for the management of ourselves in their interest… “(Andrews 49) In later works, Andrews would suggest __English statesmen continued to enforce standard imperial policies__, including various taxes to compensate for monetary losses during wartime, __because they were unable to comprehend the growing revolutionary fervor within the colonies__: “Few contemporaries in England realized the danger lurking in a persistent attempt to enforce such policies… or imagined that the methods of interference adopted after 1763 would be so far resented in the colonies as to bring about an eventual breach.”(Andrews 376) 

One of Andrews’ students, [Lawrence H. Gipson](https://gipson.cas.lehigh.edu/lawrence-henry-gipson), would later expand on these works and further develop the Imperial School. In an article for the March 1950 issue of _Political Science Quarterly_, Gipson argues that the __American Revolution amounted to a side effect of Britain’s victory in the [French and Indian War_](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1750-1775/french-indian-war)__, which “not only freed colonials for the first time…from the dread of the French, their Indian allies, and the Spaniards, but [also] opened up to them the prospect, if given freedom of action, of a vast growth in power and wealth through westward expansion.” (Gipson 102) In other words, Gipson suggests that Britain’s victory over the French in 1763 inadvertently caused the American Revolution by offering colonists in North America a vision how beneficial independence could be. Taken together, the work of Gipson and Andrews paints a much more nuanced image of the American Revolution. Instead of a noble uprising against a tyrannical ruler, as the Whigs portrayed it, __historians of the imperial school thought of the Revolution as an unintended consequence of British colonial policy__. The Imperial School held sway over the upper echelons of academic thought for some time, with Gipson even being ironically awarded the [Bancroft Prize](https://library.columbia.edu/about/awards/bancroft.html) in 1950, but it was not the only school of thought to challenge the traditional histories of America’s founding during the 20th century. 

# 1908-1968: Progressive School

Concurrent with the Imperial School in the early to mid-twentieth century was the rise of the Progressive School, named after the [Progressive Era](https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/). Scholars of this orientation critiqued traditional histories of the American Revolution by __emphasizing economic interests, challenging the myths behind the Founding Fathers, and placing historical focus on ordinary colonists__. Put another way, progressives attempted to debunk the Whiggish romanticism typical histories of the Revolutionary War included, instead offering a more realistic and critical history of the nation’s founding. 

American historian [Carl Becker](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Becker) was among the first to shape the progressive interpretation of the Revolutionary war when, in his 1915 work _The United States; An Experiment in Democracy_, he proposes a __dual revolution theory__. While Becker admits the primary struggle during the American Revolution was between the Colonies and the Crown for the right of self-government, he asserts “there was also another phase of the Revolution, and that was the struggle within the Colonies themselves between the little commercial and landowning aristocracies that had hitherto governed the Colonies and the "people," the unfranchised "humble folk," who now were coming to demand a measure of political equality.” (Becker 35) Maintaining that the Revolution began as an external political dispute, Becker further explains that evolved into an __internal economic dispute__: “…and thus the struggle against Parliamentary taxation came to be identified with the struggle against a privileged class in the colonies.” (Becker 45) This focus on class interest would go on to define the Progressive School of thought, and later authors would prove even more assertive in their critique of the usual historical narrative. 

Another early adopter of the progressive approach was historian [Charles Beard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-A-Beard), best known for his controversial work _An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States_ (1913), which reads more akin to a political treatise than a straightforward history. Beard insists that the Founding Fathers were motivated not by philosophical ideals, but by material and economic interests, declaring “whoever leaves economic pressures out of history or out of the discussion of public questions is in mortal peril of substituting mythology for reality…” going on to proclaim “It was largely by recognising the power of economic interests in the field of politics and making skilful use of them that the Fathers of the American Constitution placed themselves among the great practicing statesmen of all ages and gave instructions to succeeding generations in the art of government.” (Beard 17) In other words, Beard claims that the only reason the American Revolution occurred and the Constitution formulated is as a result of __wealthy statesmen protecting their economic interests__. Beard further substantiates this claim by remining readers which groups lacked representation at the Constitutional Convention: “the slaves, the indented servants, the mass of men who could not qualify for voting under the property tests imposed by the state constitutions and laws, and women, [all] disenfranchised and subjected to the discriminations of the common law… [and] therefore, not represented in the Convention which drafted the Constitution.” (Beard 24) In a blistering critique of traditional histories, Beard contends that the American Revolution and later the writing of the Constitution __reified existing economic hierarchies__.  

The progressive interpretation continued to produce critical histories up until the mid-twentieth centuries, wherein historians like [Merrill Jensen](https://alphahistory.com/americanrevolution/historian-merrill-jensen/) __stressed the role of the common man__ in the American Revolution. In his _Articles of Confederation : An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution_ (1940), Jensen characterizes the War of Independence as “an internal revolution carried on by the masses of the people against the local aristocracy.” (Jensen 14) Moreover, he disputes the long held notion that the Founding Fathers were champions of liberty, explaining: “as time passed and bitter experience taught them, the fathers of the Revolution repented of their radical beliefs and became conservative... Such men as George Washington, James Wilson, Robert R. Livingston… had more to fear from the people of the colonies than from British legislation.” (Jensen 92) By reframing the Revolution as a popular __uprising against aristocratic authority__, and __redefining the role of the Founding Fathers__ as puppeteers as opposed to folk heroes, Jensen offers a decidedly critical history of the American Revolution with all the hallmarks of the progressive interpretation, from a emphasis on __economic interests__ to the __de-mythologizing of revolutionary figures__.
